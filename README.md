# [IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate's Capstone Project](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/7822PTJ9X9KH) - COMPLETED!

The IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate's Capstone Project focuses on applying deep learning techniques to build and evaluate image classifiers using pre-trained models. This project allows students to demonstrate their proficiency in using PyTorch and Keras for real-world applications.

## **Project Overview**

## **Objective**

The capstone project involves building image classifiers using two different pre-trained models: ResNet18 with PyTorch and VGG16 with Keras. Students will compare the performance of these models, including a previous model built with ResNet50, to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each architecture.

## **Deep Learning Methodology**

The project follows a structured approach typical in deep learning tasks:

- **Data Preparation:** Load and preprocess image data, ensuring it is suitable for training the models. This involves resizing, normalizing, and augmenting images to improve model robustness.

- **Model Selection and Implementation:**

	- **ResNet18 with PyTorch:** Utilize the ResNet18 architecture, which includes residual connections to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, allowing for 	deeper networks. Fine-tune the model by freezing initial layers and training only the final layers on the new dataset.
	
	- **VGG16 with Keras: Implement VGG16**, known for its simplicity and effectiveness in image classification tasks. The model consists of 16 layers and is pre-trained on ImageNet. Fine-tune by adjusting the final dense layers to match the specific classification task.

- **Training and Evaluation:**

	- Train both models on a chosen dataset, using techniques such as transfer learning to leverage pre-trained weights.

	- Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy and loss. Compare results between ResNet18, VGG16, and ResNet50 to assess which model performs best under different conditions.

	Reporting: Compile findings into a comprehensive report that discusses model architecture choices, training processes, evaluation metrics, and insights gained from comparing different models.

## **Tools and Techniques**

- **Programming Frameworks:**
		- PyTorch for implementing ResNet18, leveraging its dynamic computation graph capabilities for flexibility in model building.
		- Keras for implementing VGG16, known for its user-friendly API that simplifies neural network creation.

- **Libraries:**
		- Use torchvision for data transformations and loading in PyTorch.
		- Use keras.preprocessing.image for data augmentation in Keras.

## **Outcome**

By completing this capstone project, students gain hands-on experience with state-of-the-art deep learning models and techniques. They learn how to apply theoretical knowledge to practical problems, enhancing their skills in model tuning and performance evaluation. This project also provides a valuable addition to their professional portfolio, showcasing their ability to handle complex AI engineering tasks.

This capstone emphasizes critical thinking in model selection and effective communication of technical results to stakeholders, preparing students for advanced roles in AI and machine learning fields.
